# Typescript
Learning the In and Out of Typescript

TypeScript — as its name suggests — is the typed version of JavaScript. This means we can specify types to different variables at the time of declaration.

## Data types

### Any Type

The any data type is the superset of all the data types in TypeScript. Giving any variable the type of any is equivalent to opting out of type checking for a variable.

### Built in Data types
1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. Null

### User Defined Data types

1. Arrays
2. Enum
3. Tuple
4. Class
5. Interface
